Article Title: Unethical and Illegal Practices in Coding: From Prevention to Action
Article URL: https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/articles/ethical-illegal-coding

The article I have found is very interesting and really dives into many recent scandals
displaying wrongful code use. While many of these programmers were just coding what they were told to and not doing anything malicious
the question has to be raised on how important ethics and legality are when it come to a code. One coding issue that came up in the article
was a 2015 Volkswagen scandal. Software Engineers working for Volkswagen had been falsely programming their cars to meet US environmental standarda
in labratory testing. The cars were actually emitting 40 times more CO2 then the programs stated. The software was implemented in over 11 million
cars worldwide and the punishment was a $2.8 billion criminal fine for Volkswagen. However, the article also stated a senior Volkswagen executive
got 7 years in prison, but a programmer who was just doing his job got 40 months of jail time. The case's impact on society was more environmental.
40 times more emissions than what the allowed amout is a lot, and the fact this software reached over 11 million cars is scary for the environment and
atmosphere. The issue that came from this was the dilemma on how developers should react if they recieve unethical or illegal coding jobs. Programmers 
should stand up and deny to code unethical/illegal programs for their own safety and the safety of society. The reasoning behind this are stated in
article 1.1 and 3.2 of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. 

Article 1.1 of the ACM Code of Ethics States "A Computing professional should Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all 
people are stakeholders in computing." In the Volkswagen scandal, the programmers as well as the leadership above them broke this code. Programmers
should use the code as a backbone for decision-making when trying to figure out if a job is illegal or unethical. Article 1.1 direclty corelates with societal
safety because it concerns the quality of life of all people. It mandates computer professionals to use their skills for the benefit of society. Lying about 
CO2 emissions in their cars is decieving to society. This reason alone breaks article 1.1 of general ethical principles. Another reason article 1.1 was broken
is the fact that "computing professionals should promote environmental sustainability both locally and globally." 40 times more CO2 emissions is damging to the environment
and does not look after its well being. If an article is broken I believe a programmer has the right to decline to make the certain code and the Volkswagen
programmers should have done so in this case.

Article 3.2 of the ACM Code of Ethics states "Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization
or group." The article says organizations are "oriented toward quality, transperency, and the welfare of society... leaders should encourage full participation of 
computing professionals in meeting relevant social responsibilities and discourage tendencies to do otherwise." The keyword in this quote that pertains to 
the Volkswagen case is transperency. The company was no transparent with their code and how much CO2 they were producing. Also, the leaders did not play their 
part because they did not encourage the programmers to uphold the standards in meeting relevant social responsibilities. 

Despite it seeming like an easy decision to refuse to code unethical projects, the Article I found brought up an interesting statistic that I think is important to
talk about. A study was done in 2018 and it examined how 100,000 developers would respond when face with an unethical request. "Only 58.5% of programmers stated
they would say no if they were asked to write code for an unethical purpose. 36.6% claimed it would depend on what it was, and 4.8% said they would be prepared to
do it." This is a counterargument to my argument because I said programmers should decline unethical code projects based on the ACM code of ethics, but what if someone
is part of the 40% who would consider writing the code. It all depends if they find the code unethical or not. Even with this I still stay true to my argument 
because it gives programmers the option to decline codes at the workplace along with legislation to back them up if they were to get in trouble (ACM Law of Ethics). 

In conclusion, I think we all have an obligation and ethical responsibility as computer programmers to society for how our software is used. 
If we don't think about this our code could have a negative impact on society physically, psychologically, or mentally. Also, it could fall into the 
wrong hands and be used for the wrong reasons whether malicious or not. Ethical implications to society of developing applications that treat the user as a 
product is you will lose the purpose of creating this type of technology in general. It will go from benefitting the user to make life easier 
to making more money for the developers or company.
